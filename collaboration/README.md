# Bento Collaboration Model

This project is a Java implementation of the (proposed) Bento
collaboration model.  It is intended just to see how expressable the
domain concepts are, and if the design imposes any unnecessary
constraints.  Common authorization scenarios are implemented in test
cases to show that they work and can be expressed in a straightforward
manner.

You can run the tests with Maven

    $ mvn test

or import the project as a Maven project into Eclipse (e.g. STS) and
run the tests there.
